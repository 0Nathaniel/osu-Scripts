# osu-Scripts
Scripts to help with tournament moderation/administration

Please add settings.py with the line  
apiKey = <api token>  

Also add a players.txt with a player name on each line to use the player verification formatter  
Add a mappool.txt with the url of the beatmap not the beatmap set (/b/ not /s/). Currently only works with old site urls.  
Add a single url to each line and you're good to go.
